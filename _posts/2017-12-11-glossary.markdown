I'm putting together a glossary or dictionary of common web development terms that I find myself always looking up, because even if I have heard a particular term before, I still don't have a good grasp of the concept. One way that I study, in general, is just by compiling a list of terms and ideas that keep coming up, that I know are important, and recording definitions and sometimes examples from different sources (Wikipedia, a coding website in this case like StackOverflow) and I find it helps me remember things more. So far I have:

<strong>npm</strong>:
package manager for the JavaScript programming language - default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment node.js
<br />
<strong>Node.js</strong>:
an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment for executing JavaScript server-side
<br />
<strong>Run-time system</strong>:
implements portions of an execution model
<br />
<strong>Scripting/script language</strong>:
programming language that supports scripts: programs writen for a special run-time environment that automate the execution of tasks that could alternatively be executed one-byone by a human operator
<br />
<strong>web API endpoint</strong>:
a server-side web API is a programmatic interface consisting of one or more publicly exposed endpoints to a defined request - response message system expressed in JSON or XML, which is exposed via the web, most commonly by means of an HTTP-based web server
