This is my first post using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, a static site generator. Initially I didn't really know what the purpose of Jekyll was, but now I see that it uses a collection of layouts to create a sort of template for a static website. The main theme has a very nice looking design, very minimalist (actually it's called "Minima"). I do feel a little bit guilty using a site generator, especially after learning Rails and knowing how to incorporate a fair bit of Bootstrap or Materialize CDNs. But, I decided I'm just going to use it to get a personal website up and running and have a place to display projects.

Although, as this dude Mike discusses in one of his tutorial videos on Jekyll <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtEbGztktvc">here</a>, Jekyll can be useful and fun for both someone with little to no programming experience or someone who wants to customize and change the layout files, etc. For example, I just learned about <a href="http://www.yaml.org/">YAML</a>. (It is NOT a markup language) but is actually a "human-readable data serialization language commonly used for configuration files".
